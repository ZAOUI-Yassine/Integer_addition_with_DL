# Neural Network for Integer Addition with PyTorch

This project demonstrates how a neural network can learn to perform the addition of two integers using a simple architecture. The aim is purely educational, showcasing the power of neural networks to approximate functions with minimal error.

## Summary

The project highlights:
- The use of a fully connected feedforward neural network to predict the sum of two integers.
- A simple yet effective architecture that achieves near-perfect results.
- Visualizations of the training process and evaluation to better understand how neural networks learn.

## Educational Purpose

This repository serves as a learning tool to explore:
1. How neural networks work and learn from data.
2. The capability of even basic architectures to deliver outstanding results for simple tasks.
3. Training dynamics and evaluation of neural networks in practice.

Thus, obviously we don't use neural networks to learn how to add numbers, but, this work is just to grasp the basics of training a neural network.


This project shows that even with a simple neural network (a shallow fully connected neural network), deep learning techniques can achieve remarkable accuracy for fundamental tasks like integer addition. Perfect for those looking to dive into the basics of neural networks and PyTorch.
